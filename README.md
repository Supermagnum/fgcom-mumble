 FGCom-mumble - a flightsim radio simulation framework based on mumble
 
=====================================================================

<img src="server/statuspage/inc/fgcom_logo.png" width="100px" align="left" />
This project aims to provide a mumble-based modular radio simulation for flight simulators. The project started mainly as a successor for the asterisk-based FGCom implementation.

### The main goals are:
- Provide communication with geographic and channel separation
- Provide a realistic radio simulation (incl. propagation)
- Ease of use for the end user / pilot
- Arbitary frequency support
- ATIS recording and playback
- Radio station broadcast support
- Landline/Intercom support
- RDF detection for clients
- Ease of server side installation and operation
- Standalone nature (no dependency on flightgear)
- Capability to be integrated into flightgear, with the option to support third party applications (ATC, but also other flightsims)
- **WebRTC browser client support** (implemented) - Enable web browser access while preserving all existing connection methods
- Modularity, so individual components can be easily updated and extended with new features
- Good and complete documentation

### **Realistic Radio Communication Simulator**
- **Technical Setup Required**: Server administration and technical configuration needed
- **Primary Support**: FlightGear (native) and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (via RadioGUI)
- **Realistic Communication**: Experience authentic radio procedures used by real pilots and operators
- **Educational Value**: Learn real radio communication skills and propagation physics
- **Community Support**: Join a community of aviation and radio simulation enthusiasts
- **Free to Use**: Open source with comprehensive documentation

**[Technical Setup Guide](docs/TECHNICAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive setup guide for administrators and technical users

##  **Important: Technical Complexity Assessment**

**FGCom-mumble is NOT a simple "plug and play" system.** It requires:

- **Server Administration**: Linux/Windows server management experience
- **Technical Configuration**: 625+ configuration options across 17 categories
- **Network Setup**: UDP port configuration, firewall rules, channel management
- **Radio Knowledge**: Understanding of radio frequencies and propagation
- **Complex Installation**: Multi-step process with dependencies and manual configuration

**Supported Platforms:**
- **FlightGear**: Native integration (requires technical knowledge)
- **Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020**: Via RadioGUI with SimConnect (requires technical setup)
- **Other Games**: Manual integration through Mumble voice chat (no automatic detection)

**Realistic Setup Time:**
- **Basic Setup**: 2-4 hours for experienced administrators
- **Advanced Configuration**: 1-2 days for full feature setup
- **Troubleshooting**: Additional time for configuration issues

### **Advanced Features**
See [Advanced Features](advanced_features.md) for a comprehensive overview of all advanced features and capabilities.

### Antenna Pattern Visualization:
The system includes comprehensive antenna pattern visualization showing realistic radiation patterns for various vehicle types. The purple lines represent a basic, crude representation of a JEEP vehicle (sides and wheels not shown for clarity). The "8" figure demonstrates how a typical antenna tied down at a 45Â° angle radiates, providing realistic propagation modeling for ground-based vehicles.
