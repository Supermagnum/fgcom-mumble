## Important Note: Pattern Generation Requirements

- **Aircraft radiation patterns are NOT included** in the repository due to storage constraints
- **Ground-based installation patterns are complete** and ready to use (216 patterns)
- **Marine patterns are NOT AVAILABLE** - cannot be generated due to safety limits (50,000+ combinations exceed limit, and storage constraints.
  use the --force option to fix the issue!
- **Military-land and civilian-vehicle patterns are complete** and ready to use
- **Aircraft patterns must be generated by the user** using the provided pattern generation scripts
- **Marine patterns cannot be generated** - script safety limits prevent generation (exceeds 50,000 combination limit), use the --force option to fix the issue!
- **Generation time**: Aircraft patterns can take several hours to generate (10,000+ combinations per aircraft)
- **Storage requirements**: Each aircraft requires significant disk space for all attitude combinations
- **Generation script**: Use `scripts/pattern_generation/antenna-radiation-pattern-generator.sh` to generate missing patterns
- **Progress reporting**: The script includes progress reporting showing altitude bands and completion percentage
