; Long Wire Coastal Station HF Antenna Model (North-South Orientation)
; Maritime navigation frequency (135.7-137.8 kHz)
; Specifications:
; - Frequency: 135.7-137.8 kHz (2200m amateur band)
; - Configuration: Long wire (horizontal)
; - Height: 30m above ground (vs 10m on ships)
; - Wire length: 400m (North-South orientation)
; - Ground system: Copper plates in sea water (N-S optimized)
; - Polarization: Horizontal
; - Max power: 5000W (vs 200W on ships)
; - Weight: 51.2 kg
; Antenna Design:
; - Long wire provides directional coverage
; - N-S orientation optimizes for North-South propagation
; - Enhanced N-S ground system for optimal N-S propagation
; - No ATU required (properly tuned at coastal station)
; - End-fed configuration for maximum efficiency
; Expected Performance:
; - Gain: ~10-12 dBi directional (N-S)
; - Elevation pattern: Very low angle (~2-5°)
; - SWR: <1.5:1 (no ATU required)
; - Impedance: 50Ω (properly tuned)
; - N-S orientation provides better coverage in N-S direction
; Ground Effects at 30m Height:
; - Excellent ground reference through copper plates
; - Very low elevation angle radiation
; - Directional azimuth pattern (N-S)
; - Minimal ground interaction at 136 kHz
; - N-S orientation affects ground plane efficiency
; Construction Notes:
; - Heavy-duty copper wire construction
; - Weather-sealed connections
; - Lightning protection required
; - Regular inspection of wire connections
; - N-S orientation requires proper mast alignment
; - Copper plates in sea water for optimal ground
; Typical Applications:
; - Maritime navigation communications
; - 2200m band operations
; - Historical coastal station operations
; - Long-distance communications
; - North-South propagation paths
; Optimization Notes:
; - Wire length optimized for 136 kHz
; - Enhanced N-S ground system for proper operation
; - No ATU tuning required (properly tuned)
; - Weather protection for coastal environment
; - N-S orientation for optimal propagation
; This model represents a historical coastal station long wire
; antenna suitable for 2200m operations
; as used at coastal stations before GMDSS implementation
; with North-South orientation for optimal coverage
