; Long Wire Maritime HF Antenna Model (East-West Orientation)
; Maritime navigation frequency (135.7-137.8 kHz)
; Specifications:
; - Frequency: 135.7-137.8 kHz (2200m amateur band)
; - Configuration: Long wire (horizontal)
; - Height: 10m above ground
; - Wire length: 200m (East-West orientation)
; - Ground radials: 4 × 551m (λ/4 at 136 kHz)
; - Polarization: Horizontal
; - Max power: 200W
; - Weight: 25.6 kg
; Antenna Design:
; - Long wire provides directional coverage
; - E-W orientation optimizes for East-West propagation
; - Ground radials provide proper ground reference
; - ATU required for impedance matching
; - End-fed configuration for maximum efficiency
; Expected Performance:
; - Gain: ~6-8 dBi directional (E-W)
; - Elevation pattern: Very low angle (~2-5°)
; - SWR: <2:1 with proper ATU tuning
; - Impedance: 50Ω (after ATU transformation)
; - E-W orientation provides better coverage in E-W direction
; Ground Effects at 10m Height:
; - Good ground reference through radials
; - Very low elevation angle radiation
; - Directional azimuth pattern (E-W)
; - Minimal ground interaction at 136 kHz
; - E-W orientation affects ground plane efficiency
; Construction Notes:
; - Heavy-duty copper wire construction
; - Weather-sealed connections
; - Lightning protection required
; - Regular inspection of wire connections
; - E-W orientation requires proper mast alignment
; Typical Applications:
; - Maritime navigation communications
; - 2200m band operations
; - Historical maritime operations
; - Long-distance communications
; - East-West propagation paths
; Optimization Notes:
; - Wire length optimized for 136 kHz
; - Ground radial system for proper operation
; - ATU tuning for impedance matching
; - Weather protection for marine environment
; - E-W orientation for optimal propagation
; This model represents a historical maritime long wire
; antenna suitable for 2200m operations
; as used on ships before GMDSS implementation
; with East-West orientation for optimal coverage
