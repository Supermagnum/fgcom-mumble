; T-Type Maritime HF Antenna Model (North-South Orientation)
; International distress and calling frequency
; Specifications:
; - Frequency: 500 kHz (International distress frequency)
; - Configuration: T-Type (vertical + horizontal top)
; - Height: 10m above ground
; - Vertical section: 10m
; - Horizontal section: 75m total (37.5m each side, N-S orientation)
; - Ground radials: 4 × 150m (λ/4 at 500 kHz)
; - Polarization: Vertical
; - Max power: 500W
; - Weight: 18.5 kg
; Antenna Design:
; - Vertical section provides omnidirectional coverage
; - Horizontal top section (N-S) improves low-angle radiation
; - Ground radials provide proper ground reference
; - ATU required for impedance matching
; - N-S orientation optimizes for North-South propagation
; Expected Performance:
; - Gain: ~3-4 dBi omnidirectional
; - Elevation pattern: Low angle (~5-10°)
; - SWR: <2:1 with proper ATU tuning
; - Impedance: 50Ω (after ATU transformation)
; - N-S orientation provides better coverage in N-S direction
; Ground Effects at 10m Height:
; - Good ground reference through radials
; - Low elevation angle radiation
; - Omnidirectional azimuth pattern
; - Minimal ground interaction at 500 kHz
; - N-S orientation affects ground plane efficiency
; Construction Notes:
; - Heavy-duty copper wire construction
; - Weather-sealed connections
; - Lightning protection required
; - Regular inspection of wire connections
; - N-S orientation requires proper mast alignment
; Typical Applications:
; - International distress communications
; - 500 kHz emergency operations
; - Historical maritime operations
; - Emergency communications
; - North-South propagation paths
; Optimization Notes:
; - Horizontal section length optimized for 500 kHz
; - Ground radial system for proper operation
; - ATU tuning for impedance matching
; - Weather protection for marine environment
; - N-S orientation for optimal propagation
; This model represents a historical maritime T-Type
; antenna suitable for 500 kHz operations
; as used on ships before GMDSS implementation
; with North-South orientation for optimal coverage
