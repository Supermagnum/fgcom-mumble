## Usage Instructions

### Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the master fix script to address all issues
./scripts/fix_all_issues.sh
```

### Individual Fixes
```bash
# Fix build system issues only
./scripts/setup_build_environment.sh

# Fix test suite issues only
./scripts/fix_test_suite.sh

# Fix installation issues only
./scripts/fix_installation.sh
```

### After Running Fixes
```bash
# Build the project
make build

# Install the project
sudo make install

# Set up Mumble channels
fgcom-setup-channels

# Start the service
fgcom-service start
```

## Service Management

### Service Commands
```bash
# Check service status
fgcom-service status

# Start service
fgcom-service start

# Stop service
fgcom-service stop
