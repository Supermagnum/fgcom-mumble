- 3: Readable with considerable difficulty
- 4: Readable with practically no difficulty
- 5: Perfectly readable

**S** - Signal Strength (1-9)
- 1: Faint signals, barely perceptible
- 2: Very weak signals
- 3: Weak signals
- 4: Fair signals
- 5: Fairly good signals
- 6: Good signals
- 7: Moderately strong signals
- 8: Strong signals
- 9: Extremely strong signals

**T** - Tone (1-9, for CW only)
- 1: Very rough, broad signals
- 2: Very rough, broad signals
- 3: Rough, broad signals
- 4: Rough, broad signals
- 5: Musically modulated
- 6: Musically modulated
- 7: Near DC, smooth
- 8: Near DC, smooth
- 9: Perfect tone, no trace of ripple or modulation

### Common Signal Reports
- **5 by 9**: Perfect readability, very strong signal
