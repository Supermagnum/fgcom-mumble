### **Antenna Pattern Library**
Comprehensive EZNEC-based antenna patterns for all vehicle types with automated generation workflow - Realistic 3D antenna radiation patterns that model how antennas actually radiate electromagnetic energy in different directions. These patterns are essential for authentic radio communication simulation, showing how directional antennas (like Yagi beams) have high gain in one direction and low gain in others, while omnidirectional antennas radiate equally in all horizontal directions. The system includes patterns for aircraft (affected by attitude and altitude), ground vehicles (affected by vehicle body and ground plane), and maritime platforms (affected by ship structure). This provides physics-based signal quality calculations where antenna gain directly affects communication range and quality, making the radio simulation educationally valuable and realistic.
