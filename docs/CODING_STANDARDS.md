# FGCom-Mumble Coding Standards

## Architecture & Design

### Separation of Concerns

Each function/module has a single, well-defined responsibility
State management is isolated from business logic
Hardware abstraction is separated from application logic

### Predictable State Management

Clear state machines with defined transitions
No race conditions or undefined states
Atomic operations where needed

### Scalability & Maintainability

Code can be modified without breaking existing functionality
New features can be added without major refactoring
Clear interfaces between components

## Code Quality

### Readability

Self-documenting variable and function names
Consistent formatting and style
Logical code organization

### Error Handling

Graceful handling of edge cases
Proper validation of inputs
Recovery mechanisms for failure scenarios

### Documentation

Clear comments explaining why, not just what
Function/module documentation
System-level architectural documentation

## Reliability

### Robustness

Handles unexpected inputs gracefully
Resistant to timing issues and hardware variations
Proper resource management (memory, timing, etc.)

### Testing Considerations

Code structure allows for testing
Deterministic behavior
Observable state for debugging

## Performance

### Efficiency

Appropriate algorithms for the problem domain
Minimal resource usage
Proper timing considerations for real-time systems

### Responsiveness

Meets timing requirements consistently
Proper priority handling

## Industry Standards

### Coding Standards

Follows established conventions for the language/platform
Consistent naming conventions
Appropriate use of language features

### Security

Input validation
Proper access controls
Secure coding practices

## Implementation Status

The FGCom-Mumble codebase is developed and maintained according to these coding standards. All code is reviewed and validated against these principles to ensure:

- Consistent architecture across all components
- Maintainable and extensible codebase
- High reliability and performance
- Security best practices
- Industry-standard coding conventions

These standards ensure that the codebase remains professional, maintainable, and follows best practices for software development in the aviation simulation domain.
